projectile health system problems
    most projectiles dont need health and health(-10) is repetitive
    some eat abilities basically need infinite health
projectile lifetime problems
    some projectiles (turrets) lifetime should not be limited
    some projectiles (ex. projectiles) only need to exist for 1 simulation frame, but should be visible to the player
damage taken modifiers modify healing as well
Tiny fast projectiles are hard to see
Tiny fast projectiles can sometimes pass through players without colliding

Voxel mixing makes looking through a transparent voxel to a neighbor voxel look wrong
AIR_OOB chunks can use a lot of iterations along their borders
