projectile health system problems
    some eat abilities basically need infinite health
projectile lifetime problems
    some projectiles (turrets) lifetime should not be limited
    some projectiles (ex. projectiles) only need to exist for 1 simulation frame, but should be visible to the player
damage taken modifiers modify healing as well
Tiny fast projectiles are hard to see
AIR_OOB chunks can use a lot of iterations along their borders
