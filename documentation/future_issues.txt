Sounds should be played when players activate abilities in pvp
    What determines what sound should play?
        Players can pick their own sounds
            This would be minorly inconvenient for players to do
            Could be an option for players to do if they want
        Players could pick sounds for enemy abilities
            This would be highly inconvenient for players to do every game
            Could be an option for players to do if they want
        Having enemies pick sounds for their abilities
            enemies could use misleading sounds to trick players
            enemies could use the same sound for multiple abilities to prevent ability tracking
                even preventing this they could use similar sounds
                preventing it would also stop players from using the same sound for similar abilities
        Automatically determining sounds
            Hard to do
            Likely inaccurate in many cases
            Abilities would share sounds which would prevent distinguishing between them
            Potentially viable for some simple abilities and then use something else to determine sounds for the rest
        A simple system could be to have set sounds for each ability player pair
            These sounds would make no sense and would require players to keep track of what sounds mean per game which would be annoying
    What if a player creates an ability just to play sounds to annoy enemies
    What about impact sounds
        All the same problems as ability sounds
        not all abilities should have impact sounds
    Same problems for animations
