# Lore (spoilers)

In a futuristic society people no longer need to work and therefore look to more and more extravagant ways to have fun. Despite technological advances VR never achieves the same realism as real life, but video games still offered more unique experiences than regular life. With this in mind, company Rougelife created a way for people to experience a rougelike experience in real life via setting up on new planets. People question the ethics of this venture due to the impact on native lifeforms. 

## How the rougelike experience works

The Rougelife company sets up checkpoints to act as player progression and offers a clone body for the customer to inhabit as they are sent to the planet. Memories are uploaded to the clone body so the customer can remember their past lives. The clone body is sent to the planet and the customer is given a set of equipment to start with. The customer is then sent to the planet and must reach as many checkpoints as possible.
